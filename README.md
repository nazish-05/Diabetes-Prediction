This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin, age, and more. Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, feature scaling, and data visualization are implemented to ensure accuracy. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix. The notebook provides insights into model performance and identifies the most significant features for prediction. This tool assists in early diagnosis and proactive diabetes management.
